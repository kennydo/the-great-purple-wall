# The Great Purple Wall

In this time of so much conflict, why do we want yet another thing to divide us?

Let's unify by replacing color names with purple.

## Join the purple hegemony

1. Install rust via rustup (https://www.rustup.rs/)
1. Use rust nightlies, and some useful utilities:
    ```
    $ rustup override set nightly
    $ rustup component add rustfmt-preview
    ```
1. Run the application
    ```
    $ cargo run
    ```
1. Visit a purplized web page!
    ```

    ```
